Hello There, This respositories contains all the codes that I've written on my Journey to learn Native Android - Developement using Kotlin. The Home Repo Contains a basic-app that counts number of clicks. Further inside, there are other different projects. The names and details of different projects are listed down below:

<h2>Projects in this Repository</h2>
<ul>
   <li>
      <h3>Number of Clicks</h3>
      <p>Its my first basic app that counts the number of times a particular button has been clicked in the app</p>
   </li>
   <li>
      <h3>Age Calculator</h3>
      <p>This app takes input of your birth date from date selector and then displays your age in Years/Months/Days/Hours/Minutes as desired by the user</p>
   </li>
   <li>
      <h3>Basic Calculator</h3>
      <p>To understand building UI of an app, and handling more complex operations of an android app, iI built a Basic Calculator App that resembles little to the iOS calculator app</p>
